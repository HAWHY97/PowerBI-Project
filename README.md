# PowerBI-  EXECUTIVE DASHBOARD
This shows some of the PowerBI dashboards I have worked on.

INSIGHT FROM THE EXECUTIVE DASHBOARD
1.	Sales Performance:
•	The total sales amount to $14,915,601 which indicates strong sales performance.
•	There is a fluctuation in the sales trend over time with peaks and valleys indicating possible seasonal trends or other factors affecting sales. The highest peak is seen in 2009 with over $500,000 in sales, which suggests that specific attention should be paid to what drove sales during that period.
2.	Profitability:
•	The total profit is $1,521,768. While this is a positive figure, comparing it against total sales can provide a profit margin percentage which is essential for assessing overall profitability.
•	Ontario is the top province by profit, which suggests that sales strategies in this region are particularly effective, or that it's a larger market compared to others.
3.	Shipping Costs and Efficiency:
•	The average shipping cost is relatively low at $13, suggesting efficient shipping logistics or favorable contracts with shipping providers.
•	The sum of shipping costs by ship mode shows that ‘Delivery Truck’ is the most expensive mode. 
4.	Order Value and Returns:
•	The average order value is $2,714. Knowing this, you can compare the Average Order Value to industry standards or historical data to assess performance.
•	There have been 572 returned orders. This number should be assessed in the context of total orders to understand the return rate. A high return rate might indicate issues with product quality, customer satisfaction, or order accuracy.
5.	Strategic Focus:
•	Given that the shipping cost is a significant operational expense, there might be a need to renegotiate rates with shipping companies or optimize the logistics strategy.
•	Considering the high AOV, strategies like upselling or cross-selling could be effective in further increasing sales.
6.	Regional Focus:
•	Since the profit by province varies significantly, with Nunavut being the lowest, it could be beneficial to analyze why certain provinces like Ontario perform better and apply those learnings to underperforming regions.
The dashboard provides a snapshot of the company's performance across various metrics.
